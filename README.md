> **‚ùÑÔ∏è 38% faster than pthread condition variables** ‚Äî Because life's too short for sluggish synchronisation

Fast, reliable POSIX condition variable alternatives forged during Iceland's long winter nights. When `pthread_cond_t` keeps you debugging instead of stargazing, fastcond delivers the performance that lets you spend more time on life's finer pleasures.

## üìà Performance That Speaks for Itself

| Metric | pthread | **fastcond** | Improvement |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Throughput** | 403K items/s | **559K items/s** | **üî• 38% faster** |
| **Average Latency** | 11.9 Œºs | **8.8 Œºs** | **‚ö° 26% lower** |
| **Tail Latency (max)** | 149 Œºs | **111 Œºs** | **üìâ 25% better** |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build with CMake (recommended)
cmake -B build
cmake --build build

# Run tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
# or
./scripts/run_tests.sh

# Run performance benchmarks
./scripts/run_benchmarks.sh
```

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for detailed build instructions and [dev-docs/benchmarking.md](dev-docs/benchmarking.md) for performance testing.

## Development

Before committing, format your code:
```bash
./scripts/format.sh
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines.

## Usage

They can be used instead of regular `pthread_cond_t` objects subject to the
following restrictions:

* They don't obey any non-default `pthread_condattr_t` attributes
* They don't provide *cancellation points*.
* They cannot be initialized with a static initializer

## The Weak vs Strong Showdown ü•ä

Two flavours of excellence, each with their own character:

### üí™ **Strong Condition Variables** (`fastcond_cond_t`)
*The meticulous one of the family*
- **Strict POSIX semantics** ‚Äî Only wakes threads that are already waiting (as is proper!)
- **Lower latency** ‚Äî Rather surprisingly, being particular makes it faster
- **Drop-in replacement** ‚Äî Your pthread code will feel quite at home
- **The popular choice** ‚Äî Most applications favour this one

### üèÉ **Weak Condition Variables** (`fastcond_wcond_t`) 
*The cheeky variant*
- **Relaxed semantics** ‚Äî Might wake a thread that's just turned up
- **Still faster than pthread** ‚Äî Because even our "weak" is rather strong
- **Use when** ‚Äî All your waiting threads are equivalent and interchangeable
- **For the bold** ‚Äî When you know precisely what you're about

> **Rather amusing twist:** Both versions consistently outperform dreary old `pthread_cond_t` on multicore systems. The "strong" version actually has *lower* latency despite doing more work. Quite remarkable, really! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Why Choose Fastcond? 

Because life's rather too short for sluggish condition variables, wouldn't you say? üêå‚ÜíüöÄ

**The Numbers Tell the Tale:**
- **38% higher throughput** ‚Äî Your producer-consumer patterns will be positively chuffed
- **26% lower latency** ‚Äî Messages fairly zip through the system
- **25% better tail latency** ‚Äî Even your worst-case scenarios perform rather well
- **Consistent improvements** ‚Äî Not merely cherry-picked benchmarks, proper improvements across workloads

> **üçé macOS Performance Highlight:** Particularly striking improvements on macOS, where fastcond's direct use of GCD dispatch semaphores bypasses the pthread compatibility layer. While pthread condition variables on macOS go through translation overhead, fastcond speaks the platform's native tongue. Rather like the difference between a fluent local versus going through a translator! See the [cross-platform comparison](https://kristjanvalur.github.io/fastcond/performance/) for detailed metrics.

**Platform Compatibility:**
- ‚úÖ **Linux** - Thoroughly tested and production-ready
- ‚úÖ **macOS** - Excellent performance with GCD semaphores (missing `*_timedwait` due to platform limitations)
- ‚úÖ **Windows** - Full support with native CONDITION_VARIABLE implementation (v0.2.0+)
- ‚ùì **Other POSIX** - Should work perfectly well if you have proper semaphore support
