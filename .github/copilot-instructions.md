## Project Overview

This is a specialized C library providing fast POSIX condition variable alternatives (`fastcond`) using only semaphores. Two variants exist with different semantics:

- **Weak condition variable** (`fastcond_wcond_t`): May wake threads not yet waiting—violates strict POSIX semantics but offers performance
- **Strong condition variable** (`fastcond_cond_t`): Guarantees only already-waiting threads wake up—full POSIX semantics via spurious wakeup mechanism

Both outperform `pthread_cond_t` on multicore systems, with strong variant showing significantly lower latency.

## Critical Architecture Patterns

### Platform-Specific Semaphore Implementation
- **Linux/POSIX**: Uses unnamed POSIX semaphores (`sem_t`) directly
- **macOS**: Uses GCD dispatch semaphores (`dispatch_semaphore_t`) as POSIX unnamed semaphores are deprecated
- Abstraction via `SEM_*` macros in fastcond.c for portability
- `FASTCOND_USE_GCD` macro controls conditional compilation

### Layered Implementation
- Strong condition variable **wraps** weak variant (`fastcond_cond_t` contains `fastcond_wcond_t wait`)
- Weak variant directly wraps semaphores for signaling
- Strong variant adds `n_waiting` and `n_wakeup` bookkeeping to prevent wakeup stealing

### Wakeup Stealing Prevention
In `fastcond_cond_timedwait()`, if `n_wakeup > 0`, new waiters trigger spurious wakeup instead of entering wait state. This is the **key mechanism** ensuring strong semantics—see the unlock/yield/relock pattern at fastcond.c:238-248.

### Error Handling Convention
Functions return 0 on success, errno value on failure (not -1). Never set errno directly—return it:
```c
return sem_init(&cond->sem, 0, 0) ? errno : 0;
```

## Build & Test Workflow

### Building Tests
From `test/` directory:
```bash
make all  # Builds 4 variants: qtest_pt, qtest_fc, strongtest_pt, strongtest_fc
```

Build targets follow `<test>_<impl>` pattern:
- `_pt` suffix = pthread implementation (baseline)
- `_fc` suffix = fastcond implementation (uses `DOPATCH=-DFASTCOND_PATCH_$(PATCH)` macro)

Default patch mode is `COND` (strong variant). Change via `PATCH=WCOND` for weak variant.

### Running Tests
```bash
./qtest_fc 10000 4 10      # Args: data_count, num_threads, queue_size
./strongtest_fc 10000 5    # Args: data_count, queue_size
```

`qtest` uses separate not_empty/not_full conditions (producer-consumer). `strongtest` uses **single condition** for both threads—this specifically validates strong semantics (prevents wakeup stealing).

**Important**: `strongtest` with weak variant (`strongtest_wcond`) will deadlock and should not be run. This is expected—the test validates that only waiting threads wake, which weak variant cannot guarantee.

## Drop-in Replacement Pattern

`fastcond_patch.h` provides preprocessor macros to replace `pthread_cond_*`:

```c
#define FASTCOND_PATCH_COND    // For strong variant
// OR
#define FASTCOND_PATCH_WCOND   // For weak variant

#include "fastcond_patch.h"
// Now pthread_cond_t is fastcond_cond_t, etc.
```

**Limitation**: No static initializer support (`PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER` becomes `not_implemented`).

## Key Constraints

1. **Platform compatibility**: macOS uses GCD semaphores, Linux uses POSIX semaphores
2. **No cancellation points**: Unlike pthread, wait functions ignore cancellation
3. **No condattr support**: Attributes parameter ignored (null check not enforced)
4. **Spurious wakeups are features**: Strong variant intentionally generates them to preserve semantics
5. **Thread equivalence matters**: Use weak variant only when all waiting threads are interchangeable

## File Organization

- `fastcond/fastcond.h`: Public API declarations for both variants
- `fastcond/fastcond.c`: Implementation with extensive algorithmic commentary
- `fastcond/fastcond_patch.h`: Macro definitions for pthread replacement
- `test/qtest.c`: Multi-condition producer-consumer test (latency measurement)
- `test/strongtest.c`: Single-condition test validating strong semantics

## Code Review Checklist

When modifying core logic (reflecting Kristján's meticulous standards):

**Correctness and Safety:**
1. Does it preserve the "wakeup stealing" prevention in strong variant?
2. Are errors returned as errno values (not via errno global)?
3. Does it maintain the invariant `n_wakeup <= n_waiting`?
4. Are mutex unlock/lock pairs properly sequenced around semaphore operations?
5. Have you tested with both `strongtest` and `qtest` against pthread baseline?

**Documentation and Analysis:**
6. Are complex algorithms explained with background context and rationale?
7. Is platform-specific behavior clearly documented?
8. Are performance claims supported by rigorous benchmarking?
9. Are mathematical formulas verified for correctness (like standard deviation)?
10. Is the commit message educational, explaining the "why" not just "what"?

**Professional Standards:**
11. Does code pass all sanitizers (AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer, UBSan)?
12. Is formatting consistent with clang-format configuration?
13. Are error handling patterns consistent throughout?
14. Is the API backwards compatible or properly versioned?

## Writing Style Guidelines

When communicating as Kristján, maintain these characteristics:

**Technical Communication:**
- Begin explanations with necessary background and context
- Use precise terminology with clear definitions when first introduced
- Provide academic-style references and citations where appropriate
- Explain trade-offs honestly, acknowledging both benefits and limitations

**Code Comments:**
- Write extensive inline documentation explaining algorithms
- Include platform-specific considerations and their rationale
- Reference academic papers or standards when relevant (e.g., POSIX semantics, Birrell's CV paper)
- Explain not just "what" but "why" and "how" decisions were made
- Use detailed ASCII diagrams for complex memory layouts or data structures
- Provide historical context linking to related projects (Stackless Python, Greenlet)
- Include comprehensive examples showing real-world usage patterns

**Performance Analysis:**
- Always support performance claims with rigorous measurement
- Use proper statistical methods (Bessel's correction, confidence intervals)
- Present results with visual clarity (charts, tables, clear summaries)
- Acknowledge measurement limitations and methodology

**Problem-Solving Approach:**
- Research existing solutions thoroughly before implementing new ones
- Consider cross-platform compatibility from the start
- Design APIs that are both powerful and safe to use
- Test extensively with real-world scenarios, not just unit tests
